# MAT-VRU
## **Background**

Multimodal Accessible Transportation (MAT) and Vulnerable Road User (VRU) Standards Support Project
Over the years, the United States Department of Transportation (USDOT), along with the Institute of Transportation Engineering (ITE) and their standards development partners, have been actively involved in shaping Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) standards. Recently, traditional ITS technologies have begun integrating with multimodal travel, supporting vulnerable road users. As these technologies converge, ensuring seamless integration and addressing the safety and security needs of VRUs becomes critical.  

USDOT previously had a MAT Standards project that produced a MAT Standards and VRU Cybersecurity Coordination Plan which this project is expected to build upon. Phase 1 of this project focused on addressing gaps in standards and deployment guidance for MAT and VRU technologies when integrating with ITS environments and technologies, including connected vehicle (CV) technologies. We are currently working on phase 2 of the project, which has focused on defining and implementing critical activities to better address ongoing convergence of ITS technologies with MAT and the future integration of new innovative forms of MAT.  

## **Objective**

As part of the MAT Standards and VRU Cybersecurity Plan (SCP), it was recommended that a coordination committee be established. The purpose of the SCC is to accelerate the development and adoption of MAT standards. By streamlining the development process, we can enhance accessibility for all travelers regardless of their mode of transportation. The SCC will serve as a promoter of existing and planned MAT standards and may also act as a coordinator of existing standards and standards development activities. The committee may also solicit stakeholder organizations to be involved with the development of a MAT standard, guidelines for reference implementations, security policies, and best practices for deploying standards are needed.
